## Chris Cooper

After six years working as an investment analyst at Aon, I was after a new challenge and made the decision to learn to code. I was attracted by a career in which I would be continually learning, and where I could use my problem solving skills to create things that I could be proud of.

Having come through the Makers Academy bootcamp, an intensive 12 weeks coding bootcamp, I have developed a passion for writing clean, tested and reusable code. I am now an enthusiastic full stack junior developer looking for my first role in an environment where best practices are promoted and I can continue to learn at the fast pace set whilst at Makers Academy.


## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I have worked on throughout my time at Makers Academy. More can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/cjcoops).

| Projects   | Description   | Technologies  | Testing |
| ---------- |---------------| --------------| --------- |
| [Apiify](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/apiify)  | A group project where we built a Ruby gem which helps build an API from data in csv format | Ruby, Rails, Active Record, Thor | Rspec |



## Skills

#### Communication
In my previous role as an investment consultant, I would provide investment advice to clients who often had a limited understanding of investment. This would require me to explain technical investment concepts in simple terms. The job required  me to be able to listen to a client's specific needs, but I also learnt to be persuasive and get my point across in a way which the client would understand.

#### Team Work
For each client account that I worked on, I was part of a different team. This required me to interact with new people all the time and form strong working relationships quickly.

This has benefitted me at Makers Academy where I have thoroughly enjoyed pair programming and all the group projects I have been part of. I would ensure that the group held daily stand ups and retros we could share progress, plan for the day's work and express any views and issues we were having.

#### Project Management
On a number of my clients I had the role of service manager. This meant that I was responsible for the coordination of routine and project work within each of those client teams. This would involve me liaising with both senior and junior colleagues as well as the client to ensure the work was completed. I am comfortable with managing workflow, working to deadlines, dealing with uncertainty and handling specific client requirements.

#### Self starter
Although I love to pair program and contribute as part of a team,  I am just as comfortable working on my own if necessary. I have the discipline and drive to get things done and I have shown this through studying for and passing three exams for my CFA qualification at the same time as doing my day to day job at Aon.

Makers Academy is focussed on self learning (rather than being taught) and has given me the tools I need to go out and solve problems by myself. I have shown that I am quick to learn new skills and technologies.

#### Attention to detail
At Aon I would plan and manage the transitions of large sums of money on behalf of clients. Transitions were often complex involving a number of moving parts and various parties and as such would require me to have excellent attention to detail and a thorough approach as a mistake would leave the company liable for large potential losses. Senior colleagues relied on me and trusted me to handle these projects.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2016 to February 2017)

Makers Academy is a 12 week intensive coding academy with a focus on OOP, SOLID principles, TDD and software craftsmanship and industry best practices. We pair program every day, learning through Agile and XP methodologies. Through this I have developed a passion for writing clean, tested and reusable code.

I have learnt an incredible amount in such short space of time through pair programming, learning by doing and self-guided learning. The approach is focussed on teaching how to go about solving coding problems rather than teaching us to syntax. It has made me an independent junior developer by developing my approach to problem solving and providing me with the tools I need to figure things out for myself. I won't need to continually ask a senior developer for help with minor issues as I know where to look for it.

Technologies I have used over my time here are Ruby, Rails and Javascript. Testing frameworks I have used are Rspec and Jasmine.

Look around my [github](https://github.com/cjcoops). to see how far I've come in 12 weeks.

## Experience

**AON** (September 2010 to October 2016)    
*Investment Consultant*

In my role at Aon I worked as part of a number of client teams to develop and deliver successful investment solutions for clients.

Whilst working at Aon I also earnt the CFA qualification after passing a series of three rigourous exams. I studied for these exams while also managing my regular work commitments and this required strong discipline and time management.

In my time here I spent a year on the portfolio management team where I was responsible for managing client investment portfolios and producing my own research and analysis on investments and writing material to express the team's views. I benefitted the team by building a collection of spreadsheets and chartpacks to assist the team members in monitoring portfolios and market conditions.


## Interests

When I'm not coding I enjoy keeping healthy through yoga and climbing, as well as going out to listen to live music. I also love to travel and two years ago took a career break to travel around Central and South America for six months.
