## Chris Cooper

After six years working as an investment analyst at Aon, I was after a new challenge and made the decision to learn to code. I was attracted by a career in which I would be continually learning, and where I could use my problem solving skills to build things that I could be proud of.

Having come through Makers Academy, an intensive 12 weeks coding bootcamp, I have developed a passion for writing clean, tested and reusable code. I am now an enthusiastic full stack junior developer looking for my first role in an environment where best practices are promoted and I can continue to learn at the rate set whilst at Makers Academy.


## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I have worked on throughout my time at Makers Academy.


| Projects   | Description   | Technologies  | Testing |
| ---------- |---------------| --------------| --------- |
| [Apiify](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/apiify)  | A group project where we built a Ruby gem which helps build an API from data in csv format. | Ruby, Rails, Active Record, Thor | Rspec |
| [Instagram Clone](https://github.com/cjcoops/instagram-challenge) | A homework challenge where I built an Instragram clone in my first week of using Rails. Try it [here](https://insta-clone-474.herokuapp.com/). | Ruby, Rails, JS, AJAX | Rspec, Capybara, Poltergeist |

## About me

#### Clear communication
In my previous role as an investment consultant, I would provide investment advice to clients who often had a limited understanding of investment. This would require me to explain technical investment concepts in simple terms.

I learnt to listen to a client's specific needs, but I also learnt to be persuasive and get my point across in a way which the client would understand.

#### Collaboration
For each client account that I worked on, I was part of a different team. This required me to interact with new people all the time and form strong working relationships quickly.

Group projects at Makers have given me practical, hands on experience of building applications as part of a team, holding daily stand-ups and retros and following Agile principles and XP values.

#### Project management
On a number of my clients I had the role of service manager. This meant that I was responsible for the coordination of routine and project work within each of those client teams. This would involve me liaising with both senior and junior colleagues as well as the client to ensure the work was completed.

I am extremely comfortable with managing workflow, working to deadlines, dealing with uncertainty and handling specific client requirements.

In group projects at Makers I have been successful at keeping the team focussed on the goal of reaching MVP and keeping things simple.

#### Independent problem solver
Although I love to pair program and contribute as part of a team,  I am just as comfortable working on my own if necessary. I have discipline and a strong work ethic to get things done I have shown this through studying for and passing three exams for my [CFA qualification](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx) whilst also working full time at Aon.

Makers Academy is focussed on self learning (rather than being taught) and the experience has given me the tools I need to go out and solve problems by myself. In my final project I have shown that I am quick to learn new skills and technologies.

#### Attention to detail
At Aon I would plan and manage transitions of large sums of money on behalf of clients. These transitions were often complex involving a number of moving parts and as such would require me to have excellent attention to detail and a thorough and considered approach.

Senior colleagues often commented on the accuracy of my work and could rely on me to deliver high quality work with minimal oversight. As a developer these skills have enabled me to minimise the chance of bugs in my code and also to spot them when they do occur.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2016 to February 2017)

Makers Academy is a 12 week intensive coding academy with a focus on OOP, SOLID, TDD and software craftsmanship. We learn through pair programming and working in teams on

We pair program every day learning teamwork, agile, best practices  Through this I have developed a passion for writing clean, tested and reusable code.

teamwork, best practice, TDD, agile, communication, delivering value to a user - and, most importantly, independent problem-solving.

I have learnt an incredible amount in such short space of time through pair programming, learning by doing and self-guided learning.

It has turned me into an independent junior developer by developing my approach to problem solving and providing me with the tools I need to figure things out for myself. Knowing where to look for help and solve problems myself

The main technologies I have used over my time here are Ruby and Javascript.

Look around my [github](https://github.com/cjcoops) to see how far I've come in 12 weeks.

#### Manchester Business School (September 2009 to September 2010)

#### University of Manchester (September 2006 to June 2009)

- BSc Mathematics with Finance (First)

## Experience

**AON** (September 2010 to October 2016)    
*Investment Consultant*

For the majority of my time at Aon I worked as part of a number of client teams to develop and deliver successful investment solutions for clients.

Whilst working at Aon I also earnt the [CFA qualification](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx) after passing a series of three rigourous exams.

I also spent a year on the portfolio management team where I was responsible for producing my own research and analysis on investments and preparing material to express the team's views. I improved workflow by building a collection of automated spreadsheets and chartpacks to assist the team members in monitoring portfolios and market conditions.


## Interests

When I'm not coding I enjoy keeping healthy through yoga and climbing, as well as going out to listen to live music. I also love to travel and two years ago took a career break to travel around Central and South America for six months.
