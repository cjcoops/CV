## Chris Cooper

After six years working as an investment analyst at Aon, I was eager for a new challenge and made the decision to learn to code. I was attracted by a career in which I would be continually learning, and where I could use my problem solving skills to build things that I could be proud of.

Having come through [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp, I have developed a passion for writing clean, tested and reusable code. I am now a competent and enthusiastic full stack junior developer looking for my first role in an environment where best practices are promoted and I can continue to learn at the rate set whilst at Makers Academy.

## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I have worked on throughout my time at Makers Academy.


| Projects   | Description   | Technologies  | Testing |
| ---------- |---------------| --------------| --------- |
|[Just Jam](https://github.com/Gweaton/just-jam)|A group project where in 8 days we built a web app to connect musicians looking to start a band. Try it [here](http://just-jam.herokuapp.com/).| Node.js, MongoDB, JS |Mocha, Zombie.js|
| [Instagram Clone](https://github.com/cjcoops/instagram-challenge) | A homework challenge where I built an Instragram-like web app in my first week of using Rails. Try it [here](https://insta-clone-474.herokuapp.com/). | Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, JS | Rspec, Capybara |
| [Apiify](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/apiify)  | A group project where in 4 days we built a Ruby gem which helps build an Rails API from data in csv format. | Ruby, Rails, Thor | Rspec |
| [Bowling](https://github.com/cjcoops/bowling-challenge)| A homework challenge where I built a 10 pin bowling scorer with an interface| Javascript, JQuery | Jasmine |

## Skills

#### Clear communication
In my previous role as an investment consultant, I would provide investment advice to clients who often had a limited understanding of investment. As a result I learnt how to explain technical concepts in simple terms.

I learnt to listen to a client's specific needs, but I also developed the communication skills to be persuasive and get my point across in a way in which the client would understand.

#### Collaboration
For each client account that I worked on, I was part of a different team. This required me to interact with new people with differing skillsets and knowledge and form strong working relationships quickly.

Group projects at Makers have given me practical, hands on experience of building applications as part of a team using agile methodologies and following XP values.

#### Project management
On a number of my clients I had the role of service manager which meant that I was responsible for the coordination of routine and project work within each of those client teams. This would involve me liaising with both senior and junior colleagues as well as the client to ensure the work was completed on time and within budget.

I am extremely comfortable with managing workflow, working to deadlines, dealing with uncertainty and handling specific client requirements. In group projects at Makers, other students commented on my ability to keep the team focussed on the goal of reaching MVP and keeping things simple.

#### Independent problem solver
Although I love to pair program and contribute as part of a team,  I am just as comfortable working on my own if necessary. I have the discipline and a strong work ethic to get things done and have shown this through studying for and passing three exams for my [CFA qualification](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx) whilst also working full time at Aon.

Makers Academy is focussed on self learning and through the experience I have acquired the tools I need to learn new technologies quickly and solve problems by myself. For example my [final project](https://github.com/Gweaton/just-jam) was built using Node.js and MongoDB, technologies I had no prior experience using.

#### Attention to detail
At Aon I would plan and manage transitions of large sums of money on behalf of clients. These transitions were often complex involving a number of moving parts and as such would require me to have excellent attention to detail and a thorough and considered approach.

Senior colleagues often praised the high quality and accuracy of my work and could rely on me to deliver with minimal oversight. As a developer these skills have enabled me to minimise the chance of bugs in my code although my love for problem solving means I enjoy seeking them out when they do occur!

## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2016 to February 2017)

Makers Academy is a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp with a focus on OOP, SOLID, TDD, and software craftsmanship. Through this I have developed a passion for writing clean, tested and reusable code.

Through pair programming and a learn-by-doing approach, I have learnt an incredible amount in a relatively short period of time. The experience has given me the tools I need to solve problems on my own and to become an independent junior developer.

Not only have I learnt how to code, but the course has also provided me with practical hands on experience of working as part of an agile team and ultimately how to deliver value to a user.

Look around my [Github](https://github.com/cjcoops) to see how far I've come in 12 weeks.

#### Manchester Business School (September 2009 to September 2010)

- MSc Quantitative Finance and Financial Engineering (Merit)

#### University of Manchester (September 2006 to June 2009)

- BSc Mathematics with Finance (First)

## Experience

**AON** (September 2010 to October 2016)    
*Investment Consultant*

For the majority of my time at Aon I worked as part of a number of client teams to develop and deliver successful investment solutions for clients.

Whilst working at Aon I also earnt the [CFA qualification](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx) after passing a series of three rigorous exams.

I also spent a year on the portfolio management team where I was responsible for producing my own research and analysis on investments and preparing material to express the team's views. I was praised for improving workflow by building a collection of automated spreadsheets and chartpacks to assist the team members in monitoring portfolios and market conditions.


## Interests

When I'm not coding I enjoy keeping healthy through yoga and climbing, as well as listening to live music. I also love to travel and two years ago took a career break to travel around Central and South America for six months.
